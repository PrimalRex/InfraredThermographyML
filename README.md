# InfraredThermographyML
Machine Learning to detect feverous individuals

The goal of this is to investigate regression vs neural models on the Infrared Thermography Dataset.
                                                                                                                                         This report investigates how regressive models perform alongside a neural model which is crafted through gradual solving of overfitting via regularisation techniques and analysis of hyperparameters to fine tune to achieve an MSE of `0.0630` and `0.0347` in regression and neural respectively for aveOralF, aswell as an MSE of `0.0687` and `0.0347` in regression and neural respectively for aveOralM.
